Utilyzing Javascript, Vite, and custom assets that were imported, I created a small point and click retro style video game as an assignment for an anthropology course. This game goes through and explains elemnents and historical components of Witchcraft and shamanism, from a conginitve analysis viewpoint.

The game is hosted via github pages using a custom workflow, and can be found here https://raven252525.github.io/WitchCraft_Shamanism_Minigame/
